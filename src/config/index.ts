      Hello, I'm Neil Justin Mallari, an enthusiastic Software Engineer currently pursuing
      my Computer Science degree. I've dedicated years to refining my expertise
      in full-stack development.
      
      I am presently part of the skilled engineering team at Career TEAM, a
      US-based company. Our technology stack centers around Next.js, NestJS,
      MongoDB, and TypeScript.

      Beyond my professional work, I've built various personal projects using
      Express and am currently expanding my skills by learning PHP with Laravel.
